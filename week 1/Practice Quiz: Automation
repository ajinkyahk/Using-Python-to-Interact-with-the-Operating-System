Question 4
A company is looking at automating one of their internal processes and wants to determine if automating a process would save labor time this year. 
The company uses the formula [time_to_automate < (time_to_perform * amount_of_times_done) to decide whether automation is worthwhile. 
The process normally takes about 10 minutes every week. 
The automation process itself will take 40 hours total to complete. 
Using the formula, how many weeks will it be before the company starts saving time on the process?

240 weeks
